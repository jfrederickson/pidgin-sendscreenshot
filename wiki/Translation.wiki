=Howto=

We use [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ GNU gettext] to translate the plugin.

==Experienced user==

If you're an experienced gettext user, please send me your new/updated _.po_ file directly.

==New to gettext ?==

Please send me an email where you specify which language you want to translate, then *I will send you back a _.po_ file*.

This file contains all the messages to be translated.

Under Linux, there are some good _.po_ file [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Editing editors]. Under Microsoft Windows, have a look at [http://www.poedit.net/ poedit].

Once the _.po_ file is filled with your translation, please send it back to me.

=Notes=

I know it takes time to translate.
Well, you don't have to translate everything in the _.po_ file.
Just translating the messages from the preferences window and the menuitems is fine.
You can skip error messages at first and translate them later.
