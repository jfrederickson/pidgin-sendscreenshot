Pidgin send-screenshot comes a list of image hosting providers and let you upload your screenshots to one of them.

We recommend the following providers :

 * [http://imgur.com/ imgur]


Here, you'll learn how to add a custom image hosting provider.

= Add your own =

==Syntax==

You must have a basic knowledge about [http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_forms.asp html forms] and [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html Perl regular expressions].
Here is the *xml synthax* you have to use:

{{{
       <host name="Hostname (as it will appear in the configure dialog)">
            <param location="Country where the server is located">. Not currently used.
            <param form_action="Server-side form handler"/> 
            <param file_input_name="Name of the file-select control."/>
            <param regexp="Perl regexp to mach with the (direct image link)"/.> The interesting part must be surrounded by parenthesis.

            <param name="extra name1" value="extra value1"/>
              ...
	    <param name="extra name_n" value="extra value_n"/>
        </host>
}}}


==Where to ?==

The action takes place in the _"send-screenshot_data"_ folder.
It is usually located in:
 * _Drive:\Program Files\Pidgin\_ under Microsoft Windows,
 * _/usr/share/_ under Mac and Linux.

Please open _*"img_hosting_providers.xml"*_, then add the new xml block (and remove the providers you don't need).

Located in the _"icons"_ subfolder.
Must be _PNG_ format and 32x32 sized.
Name must be "Hostname.png"
